## General Guidelines

- To complete projects, students needs to pass code reviews by multiple peers. The evaluatee needs to be able to explain their code and its validity - since students have varying levels of perfectionism, we often defer to the restrictions imposed by assignment instructions (and the discuss implicit leeways).
- For all projecting using the C programming language, students are required to follow the "Norm" - a set of code style and linting rules. Some of these rules can be validated with the "norminette" program and some are left for human evaluators.  

  These Norm rules include, but are not limited to:
  - No `for` loops, or `switch` statements, or ternary statements
  - Variable names in snake_case - struct names start with `s_`, typedef names start with `t_`
  - Variable declarations at the beginning of functions
  - No assignment in declarations (except for `const`/`static`/`global` variables)
  - Up to:
    - 80 characters per line
    - 25 lines per function
    - 4 function parameters
    - 5 variable declarations per function
    - 5 functions per file
  - No unused library inclusions
  - No comments inside functions
