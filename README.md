## General Guidelines
- To finish a project, a student needs to pass multiple successful code reviews by peers. The evaluatee needs to be able to explain their code and "defend" why it's valid (if it is) - since students have varying levels of perfectionism and there's _some_ subjectivity to software engineering, we often defer to (and discuss) the wording of the assignment in evaluations.
- For all projecting using the C programming language, we were required to follow the "Norm" version 4: A set of code style rules (e.g. no "for" or "do-while" loops, no ternary statements, maximum of 25 lines per function), linting rules (e.g. no unused library inclusions), and other guidelines (e.g. maximum of 4 function parameters and 5 variable declarations, no assignment in the same line as declaration except for consts or statics)
