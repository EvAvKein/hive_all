## Project Guidelines

- To complete projects, students needs to pass code reviews from multiple peers. The evaluatee needs to be able to explain their code and its validity - since students have varying levels of perfectionism, we often defer to the restrictions imposed by assignment instructions (and discuss any implicit leeways).
- __For all projects using the C programming language__, students are required to follow the "Norm" - a set of code style and linting rules. Some of these can be validated with the "norminette" program and some are left for human review.
These Norme rules include, but are not limited to:
  - No comments inside functions
  - No `for` loops, or `switch` statements, or ternary statements
  - Variable declarations at the beginning of functions, single declaration per line
  - No assignments in declarations (except for `const`/`static`/`global` variables)
  - Up to:
  - 80 characters per line
  - 25 lines per function
  - 4 function parameters
  - 5 variable declarations per function
  - 5 functions per file
